# OTAsimulator
Project created for my last internship

The main file for this simulator to run is the OTASimulator.py file
The simulator creates a certain amount of vehicles that communicate 
to a fixed end using the MQTT broker.  The GUI allows you to specify
what messages the vehicles should send and then the fixed end sends an
automated response back.
